# hapax-constitution

Governance specification for a research project implementing Clark & Brennan's (1991) conversational grounding theory in a production voice AI system, evaluated via Single Case Experimental Design (SCED) with Bayesian analysis. See [hapax-council](https://github.com/ryanklee/hapax-council) for the primary research artifact and experiment design.

## Role in the workspace

This repository is a specification, not application code. YAML files define the constitutional axiom set; markdown describes the architecture. The `hapax-sdlc` package (published from this repo) provides enforcement tooling that consumers run.

Two consumers extend the spec via the published package:

| Consumer | Domain extensions | Package |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| [hapax-council](https://github.com/ryanklee/hapax-council) | `single_user`, `executive_function`, `corporate_boundary`, `interpersonal_transparency`, `management_governance` | `hapax-sdlc` |
| [hapax-officium](https://github.com/ryanklee/hapax-officium) | `single_operator`, `decision_support`, `management_safety` | `hapax-sdlc[demo]` |

Changes to `axioms/registry.yaml` propagate to both consumers on the next dependency bump.

## Governance architecture

The architecture follows constitutional law in structure: weighted axioms, derived implications at graduated enforcement tiers, interpretive canons for unanticipated cases, and a precedent store for accumulated rulings.

### Axioms and implications

Axioms are weighted constraints defined in `axioms/registry.yaml`. Each axiom produces derived implications.

| Axiom | Weight | Core constraint |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `single_user` | 100 | One operator. No auth, no roles, no multi-user features. |
| `executive_function` | 95 | Compensates for executive-function challenges. Zero-config agents, actionable errors, automated routines. |
| `corporate_boundary` | 90 | Work data stays in employer systems. Graceful degradation across network boundaries. |
| `interpersonal_transparency` | 88 | No persistent state about non-operator persons without an active consent contract. |
| `management_governance` | 85 | LLMs prepare context; humans deliver words. No generated feedback language or coaching recommendations about individuals. |

~90 implications across four enforcement tiers: T0 (block at commit), T1 (require review), T2 (warn), T3 (lint). Tier graduation follows the logic of levels of scrutiny in constitutional law. Each implication carries an enforcement mode (`compatibility`, `blocking`, `monitoring`) and applies at one of three levels (capability, subsystem, operator).

### Interpretive canons

Four canons handle unanticipated cases:

| Canon | Use |
|-------|-----|
| `textualist` | Literal axiom text, strict application; primary canon for T0 blocks |
| `purposivist` | Axiom intent, contextual reasoning when literal reading is too narrow |
| `absurdity` | Reject literal applications producing absurd results |
| `omitted-case` | Apply nearest precedent; escalate when no precedent exists |

### Precedent store

Operator rulings on edge cases are recorded under `axioms/precedents/` with situation, reasoning, resolution, and scope. Precedents carry authority weights (operator 1.0, agent 0.7, derived 0.5) and are append-only with supersession tracking. Future evaluations query the precedent store semantically (Qdrant) before escalating.

### Sufficiency probes

Implications carry a mode: prohibition (must not do) or sufficiency (must do). The enforcement engine runs both. The `executive_function` axiom requires that every error message contains a concrete next action; a system that never generates feedback language but also never includes next actions passes prohibition checks while failing sufficiency.

### Deliberative process (Publius/Brutus)

For contentious governance events — supremacy tensions, dissent thresholds (3+ dissents), new implications, weight changes, precedent supersession, canon challenges — the deliberation pipeline runs two opposed agents (Publius and Brutus) and produces a structured deliberation record (YAML) with both arguments, supporting precedents, and proposed resolution. The operator decides; neither agent decides. Spec: [`docs/design/deliberative-governance.md`](docs/design/deliberative-governance.md).

## Structural patterns

Two patterns are specified alongside axiom governance:

**Filesystem-as-bus.** Coordination state as markdown files with YAML frontmatter on disk. No message broker, no database, no RPC. Trades transactional consistency for human-readable state, git-native history, and tool-agnostic interoperability. At single-operator scale, the consistency trade-off has no practical cost. Independently described by "From Everything-is-a-File to Files-Are-All-You-Need" (arXiv:2601.11672) and "Everything is Context" (arXiv:2512.05470).

**Three-tier agent architecture.** Tier 1 (interactive: Claude Code, dashboards), Tier 2 (on-demand: pydantic-ai agents), Tier 3 (autonomous: systemd timers). Agents communicate through filesystem artifacts; no orchestrator or workflow engine.

## Related work

Several independent formalizations of agent governance appeared in late 2025 and early 2026: ArbiterOS (arXiv:2510.13857), Agent Behavioral Contracts (arXiv:2602.22302), PCAS (arXiv:2602.16708), Governance-as-a-Service (arXiv:2508.18765). This architecture converges on similar structural conclusions and adds interpretive canons, sufficiency probes, and personal axioms (governance tailored to a specific operator's cognitive constraints).

## Repo presentation pipeline

The `hapax-sdlc` package (published from `sdlc/` and `hapax_sdlc/` shim) renders eight artifacts into the seven first-party repos:

| Artifact | Render mode | Source |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `CITATION.cff` | Full overwrite | `sdlc/render/citation_cff.py` |
| `codemeta.json` | Full overwrite | `sdlc/render/codemeta_json.py` |
| `.zenodo.json` | Full overwrite | `sdlc/render/zenodo_json.py` |
| `NOTICE.md` | Full overwrite | `sdlc/render/notice_md.py` |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Full overwrite | `sdlc/render/contributing_md.py` |
| `SECURITY.md` | Full overwrite | `sdlc/render/security_md.py` |
| `GOVERNANCE.md` | Full overwrite | `sdlc/render/governance_md.py` |
| `README.md` preamble | Section replacement between `<!-- hapax-sdlc:preamble:begin/end -->` markers | `sdlc/render/readme_section.py` |

The README preamble preserves the per-repo body. The `OperatorReferentPicker` selects one of four equally-weighted non-formal referents (`The Operator`, `Oudepode`, `Oudepode The Operator`, `OTO`) per artifact deterministically from the repo id.

### CLI

```bash
python -m hapax_sdlc.render --all                  # Render all 7 first-party repos
python -m hapax_sdlc.render --repo hapax-council   # Render one repo
python -m hapax_sdlc.render --all --check          # Drift mode; exit 1 on diff (CI)
python -m hapax_sdlc.render --all --dry-run        # Print to stdout
python -m hapax_sdlc.render --repo X --file CITATION.cff  # Render one artifact
```

The render entrypoint is defined in `sdlc/render/cli.py`. Operator identity is loaded from `sdlc/operator.yaml` (or `sdlc/operator.local.yaml` if present, gitignored).
